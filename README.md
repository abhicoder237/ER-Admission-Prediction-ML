Project Title & Tagline
 

Predicting Emergency Department Admissions using real hospital data


Problem Statement

Hospital ERs face overcrowding. Predicting patient admissions helps optimize resources.

Data Description

Source (Iran ED dataset)

Features (age, triage, vitals, etc.)

Target variable (Admission: Yes/No)

Planned Methodology

Steps: Data cleaning → EDA → Feature Engineering → ML models → Evaluation → Explainability

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Expected Outcomes / Goals

Build a predictive model to identify likely admissions

Evaluate with RMSE / Accuracy / F1 Score

Use SHAP for explainability

Project Scope / Future Work

Extend to other hospitals

Include more features (season, weekday, comorbidities)

Deploy a simple dashboard for ER planning
